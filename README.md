# Spam-Email-detection-using-supervised-learning
Emails are widely used as a means of communication for personal and professional use. The
information exchanged over mails is often sensitive and confidential such as banking information,
credit reports, login details etc. making them valuable to cyber criminals for malicious purposes.
Phishing is a strategy used by fraudsters to obtain sensitive information from people by pretending
to be from recognized sources. In a phished email, the sender can convince you to provide personal
information under false pretenses. This experimentation considers the detection of a phished email
as a classification problem and describes the use of machine learning algorithms to
classify emails as phished or ham. I have covered this in three parts, namely Na√Øve Bayes,
general models and neural network models, in order to find the most effective method to overcome
phishing attacks. We do this by calculating and comparing the accuracy of spam and ham
detection, at the same time the time efficiency of each method.
